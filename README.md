# dygma-raise

Keyboard map for digma raise keyboard

## How to use

- Open the Bazecor Application
- Select the layer you wish to update
- Select the `gear` icon
- Select `Load single layer`
- Select the desired file and load it

## Layout goals

I want to create a smooth transition to using the thumb cluster.

Open questions - should it replace the pinky keys or should it be more about new layers?

### Main Layout

general usage and text editing with arrow keys in the right hand corner.
